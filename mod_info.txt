1.本mod的主体来自热带体验(tropical experience),已获得原mod作者授权,只保留了海难和哈姆雷特部分.
代码方面大量参考了岛屿冒险(island adventure)这也是为什么这个mod的名字叫做热带冒险(tropical adventure).
请注意，这是一个完整的mod,并不是一个补丁,所以请不要同时开启 tropical experience 或者 island adventure.

2.本mod进行了大量的细节调整.目前主要修改为世界生成的调整和哈姆雷特房间系统的调整. 
简化了mod设置,哈姆雷特所有遗迹房间改造成了洞穴迷宫放在了地下. 气候系统会逐步重写.
现在玩家在房间内放置建筑更加灵活了.玩家在放置墙上建筑如墙饰和窗户可以用pageup 和pagedown旋转方向,通过上下键调整高度.

This mod is derived from the "Tropical Experience" and has been permitted by the original mod author.
The mod retains only the contents of Shipwrecked and Hamlet. 
The code heavily references "Island Adventure," which is also why this mod is named "Tropical Adventure." 
Please note that this is a complete mod, not a patch, so do not enable Tropical Experience or Island Adventure with this mod.

This mod has many personal adjustments, primarily focusing on adjustments to world generation and the Hamlet room system. 
Mod settings have been simplified, and all Hamlet ruin rooms have been transformed into cave mazes. 
The climate system will be rewritten in the future. 
Players now have greater flexibility when placing buildings inside rooms.
When placing structures on room walls, such as wall decorations and windows, rotation can be made using PageUp and PageDown keys, 
while height adjustments can be made with the arrow keys.
